ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Loading and Structure
The dataset was loaded using pandas from a CSV file.

It contains 1000 rows and 9 columns, likely representing retail transactions.

A .head() preview was used to check the first few rows of the dataset.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Cleaning
Used .isnull().sum() to check for missing values â€” none were found, meaning the data is complete.

The Date column was converted from string to datetime format for time-based analysis.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Descriptive Statistics
.describe() was used to get an overview of numeric columns.

Helped understand data distribution (mean, std, min, max, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ 4. Time Series Analysis
A bar chart was created to show total sales over time (monthly).

The dataset was grouped by Month (extracted from the Date column).

A seasonal subseries plot was made to analyze average sales per month â€” this helps identify high and low performing months.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Data Visualization
Used matplotlib and seaborn to:

Plot monthly trends.

Highlight seasonal sales patterns.

Possibly visualize other sales metrics (e.g., revenue, quantity sold).

Conclusion & Insights
The EDA was well-structured and focused on:

Understanding trends over time.

Cleaning and preparing data for deeper analysis or modeling.

Using visualizations to highlight key patterns.

This type of EDA is useful for businesses to:

Plan inventory based on seasonal trends.

Identify peak sales periods.

Evaluate product performance.

Forecast future sales using time series models (if extended further).
